# Contributing to Vapor Make Migration

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and inclusive. We're all here to build something great together.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork yourusername/vapor-make-migration
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vapor-make-migration.git
   cd vapor-make-migration
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

4. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Write your code
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass: `swift test`
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Commit your changes with clear messages

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add support for MySQL constraints introspection
fix: resolve issue with UUID type mapping
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for schema comparison
refactor: simplify migration generator code
```

Prefixes:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Testing

All new features must include tests:

```swift
@Suite("Your Feature Tests")
struct YourFeatureTests {

    @Test("Describe what this tests")
    func testSomething() {
        #expect(someCondition == true)
    }
}
```

Run tests with:
```bash
swift test                    # Run all tests
swift test --filter YourTest  # Run specific test
```

### Code Style

- Follow Swift naming conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use modern Swift features (async/await, etc.)

Example:
```swift
/// Generates migration code from schema differences
public struct MigrationGenerator {
    public init() {}

    /// Generates Swift migration file content
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - diff: The schema differences to migrate
    ///   - name: Name for the migration
    /// - Returns: Swift migration code as a string
    public func generate(diff: SchemaDiff, name: String) -> String {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Provide clear description
   - Add screenshots if UI-related

4. **Code Review**
   - Address review comments
   - Push additional commits if needed
   - Tests must pass

5. **Merge**
   - PR will be merged by maintainers
   - Your branch will be deleted
